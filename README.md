# GitLab Plugin for Neovim

This extension integrates GitLab Duo with Neovim. It's built with Lua.
This extension provides:

- GitLab Duo Code Suggestions.
- [Omni Completion key mapping](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/editor_extensions/neovim/#configure-omni-completion).
- Vim auto-commands.
- Local editing of GitLab issues, epics, and merge requests.

## GitLab Duo Code Suggestions

Use GitLab Duo Code Suggestions to write code more efficiently by using generative AI to suggest code while you're
developing. It's a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model that uses
[Google Cloud's Vertex AI Codey API models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/code/code-models-overview).

To learn more about this feature, see the
[GitLab Duo Code Suggestions documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions/index.html)
and the list of [supported languages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions/supported_extensions.html#supported-languages).

No new additional data is collected to enable this feature. Private non-public
GitLab customer data is not used as training data. Learn more about
