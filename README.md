# GitLab Plugin for Neovim

This is a fork from: [Gitlab Duo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab.vim).
This fork contains the following extra features for the inline suggestions:

- insert the next word
- restore the last word
- insert the next line
- restore the last line

Other difference are:

- the setting `statusline.enabled` also accepts a function with the signature:

  ```lua
  ---For a customized update based on the status of the plugin.
  ---@param status number Corresponds to `gitlab.globals`.
  function(status) end
  ```

This extension integrates GitLab Duo with Neovim. It's built with Lua.
This extension provides:

- GitLab Duo Code Suggestions.
- [Omni Completion key mapping](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/editor_extensions/neovim/#configure-omni-completion).
- Vim auto-commands.
- Local editing of GitLab issues, epics, and merge requests.

With Duo Code Suggestions, you get:

- **Code completion**, which suggests completions for the current line you are typing.
  These suggestions usually have low latency.
- **Code generation**, which generates code based on a natural-language code comment block.
  Responses for code generation are slower than code completion, and returned in a single block.

To learn more, see:

- [Code Suggestions documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html)
- [Supported languages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#supported-languages)
