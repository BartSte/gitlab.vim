## Features

### GitLab Duo Code Suggestions (Beta)

Write code more efficiently by using generative AI to suggest code while youâ€™re developing. To learn more about this feature, see the
[GitLab Duo Code Suggestions documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#enable-code-suggestions-in-vs-code)

This feature is in
[Beta](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/experiment-beta-support.html#beta)
GitLab Duo Code Suggestions is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model. GitLab currently leverages [Google Cloudâ€™s Vertex AI Codey API models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/code/code-models-overview)

No new additional data is collected to enable this feature. Private non-public GitLab customer data is not used as training data.
Learn more about [Google Vertex AI Codey APIs Data Governance](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/data-governance)

Beta users should read about the [known limitations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#known-limitations)

#### Supported Languages

Languages supported by GitLab Duo Code Suggestions can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#supported-languages).

#### Usage
See [doc/gitlab.txt](./doc/gitlab.txt) or run `:help gitlab.txt` to read usage information without leaving your editor.

If you get `E149: Sorry, no help for gitlab.txt` you will need to generate helptags before restarting Vim using either:

* `:helptags ALL`
* `:helptags doc/` from inside the plugin's root directory.

##### Keymaps

If using `gitlab.code_suggestions` with the builtin LSP client and Omni completion:
- `ctrl-x ctrl-o` requests completions from GitLab Duo Code Suggestions

#### Status Bar

A status icon is displayed in the status bar. It provides the following:

1. A button that can quickly disable/enable code suggestions.
1. Display a code suggestion in progress icon.
1. Display an error icon and provide an error message as tooltip.
1. Before the extension has been configured, the error icon will be shown with a message about configuration.
