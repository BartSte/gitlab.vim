## Requirements

| Software | Version |
| -------- | ------- |
| [GitLab SaaS](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#enable-code-suggestions-on-gitlab-saas) | 16.1+ |
| [GitLab self-managed](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#enable-code-suggestions-on-self-managed-gitlab) | 16.1+ |
| [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) | 0.9+ |

## Setup

### Getting started

1. Install the [latest Neovim release](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest)

    - For macOS, this can be achieved by running `brew install neovim`

1. Clone this repository into `~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/gitlab/start/gitlab.vim`

    ```sh
    git clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab.vim.git ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/gitlab/start/gitlab.vim
    ```

1. Setup helptags using `:helptags ALL` for access to [:help gitlab.txt](doc/gitlab.txt).

To enable completion using Code Suggestions:

1. Follow the steps to enable [Code Suggestions (Beta)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html) for your GitLab instance (SaaS or self-managed).

   1. Enable Code Suggestions for your GitLab group/user.
   1. Create a [Personal Access Token][] with the `read_api` scope.
   1. Install the GitLab Duo Code Suggestions [language server][].
   1. Configure [Omni completion](https://neovim.io/doc/user/insert.html#compl-omni-filetypes)'s popup menu:

      ```lua
      vim.o.completeopt = 'menu,menuone'
      ```

   1. Use `ctrl-x ctrl-o` to open the Omni completion popup menu inside of supported filetypes.

### Uninstalling

To uninstall run the following commands:

```
rm ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/gitlab/start/gitlab.vim
rm ~/.local/share/nvim/gitlab-code-suggestions-language-server-*
```

### Troubleshooting

1. Setup helptags using `:helptags ALL` for access to [:help gitlab.txt](doc/gitlab.txt).

1. Confirm the language server is executable outside of vim.

1. Enable debug logging to `/tmp/gitlab.vim.log` environment variables defined under `:help gitlab-env`.

1. Confirm whether you face the same issues when starting a fresh Neovim session with `nvim --clean` and sourcing the minimal [spec/init.lua](./spec/init.lua).

### Release Process

1. Review whether each merge request since the last release has/requires a changelog entry.

1. Create a new merge request to increment the plugin version.

   1. Update `PLUGIN_VERSION` in [lua/gitlab/globals.lua](./lua/gitlab/globals.lua).

   1. Add a new `## vX.Y.Z` header above the previous [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) entry.

1. Merge the merge request once it has been approved.

1. Create a new signed git tag off of the `main` branch.

## Features

### GitLab Duo Code Suggestions (Beta)

Write code more efficiently by using generative AI to suggest code while youâ€™re developing. To learn more about this feature, see the
[GitLab Duo Code Suggestions documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#enable-code-suggestions-in-vs-code)

This feature is in
[Beta](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/experiment-beta-support.html#beta)
GitLab Duo Code Suggestions is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model. GitLab currently leverages [Google Cloudâ€™s Vertex AI Codey API models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/code/code-models-overview)

No new additional data is collected to enable this feature. Private non-public GitLab customer data is not used as training data.
Learn more about [Google Vertex AI Codey APIs Data Governance](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/data-governance)

Beta users should read about the [known limitations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#known-limitations)

#### Supported Languages

Languages supported by GitLab Duo Code Suggestions can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#supported-languages).

#### Usage
See [doc/gitlab.txt](./doc/gitlab.txt) or run `:help gitlab.txt` to read usage information without leaving your editor.

If you get `E149: Sorry, no help for gitlab.txt` you will need to generate helptags before restarting Vim using either:

* `:helptags ALL`
* `:helptags doc/` from inside the plugin's root directory.

##### Keymaps

If using `gitlab.code_suggestions` with the builtin LSP client and Omni completion:
- `ctrl-x ctrl-o` requests completions from GitLab Duo Code Suggestions

#### Statusline

Enabling `gitlab.statusline` will indicate the status of the GitLab Duo Code Suggestions integration.
