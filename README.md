## Requirements

| Software | Version |
| -------- | ------- |
| [GitLab SaaS](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#enable-code-suggestions-on-gitlab-saas) | 16.1+ |
| [GitLab self-managed](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#enable-code-suggestions-on-self-managed-gitlab) | 16.1+ |
| [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) | 0.9+ |

## Setup

1. Follow the [installation](#installation) steps for your chosen plugin manager.

   1. _Optional:_ Configure GitLab Duo Code Suggestions as an [Omni completion](#omni-completion) provider.

1. Setup helptags using `:helptags ALL` for access to [:help gitlab.txt](doc/gitlab.txt).

### Installation

To install the GitLab Vim plugin:

1. Clone Neovim's packpath which is included by [packadd][] on startup.

   ```sh
   git clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab.vim.git ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/gitlab/start/gitlab.vim
   ```

1. Add the following plugin to your [lazy.nvim][] configuration:

   ```lua
   {
     url = "git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab.vim.git",
     lazy = false,
   }
   ```

1. Declare the plugin in your [packer.nvim][] configuration:

   ```lua
   use {
     "git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab.vim.git",
   }
   ```

#### Uninstalling

1. Manual installation:
   1. Clone this repository into your `pack` directory:

      ```sh
      rm -r ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/gitlab/start/gitlab.vim
      rm ~/.local/share/nvim/gitlab-code-suggestions-language-server-*
      ```

### Omni completion

To enable [omni completion](https://neovim.io/doc/user/insert.html#compl-omni-filetypes) using GitLab Duo Code Suggestions:

1. Follow the steps to enable [GitLab Duo Code Suggestions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html) for your GitLab instance (SaaS or self-managed).
1. Enable Code Suggestions for your GitLab group/user.
1. Create a [Personal Access Token][] with the `api` scope.
1. Install the GitLab Duo Code Suggestions [language server][].

You may find it helpful to configure omni completion's popup menu even for a single suggestion:

   ```lua
   vim.o.completeopt = 'menu,menuone'
   ```

1. Use `ctrl-x ctrl-o` to open the Omni completion popup menu inside of supported filetypes.

## Features

### GitLab Duo Code Suggestions (Beta)

Write code more efficiently by using generative AI to suggest code while youâ€™re developing. To learn more about this feature, see the
[GitLab Duo Code Suggestions documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#enable-code-suggestions-in-vs-code)

This feature is in
[Beta](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/experiment-beta-support.html#beta)
GitLab Duo Code Suggestions is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model. GitLab currently leverages [Google Cloudâ€™s Vertex AI Codey API models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/code/code-models-overview)

No new additional data is collected to enable this feature. Private non-public GitLab customer data is not used as training data.
Learn more about [Google Vertex AI Codey APIs Data Governance](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/data-governance)

Beta users should read about the [known limitations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#known-limitations)

#### Supported Languages

Languages supported by GitLab Duo Code Suggestions can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#supported-languages).

For convenience a `code_suggestions.auto_filetypes` default value can be used to configure starting Code Suggestions when you a buffer with the correct type is opened.

Run the following command `FileType` autocmds for:

```
:lua =require('gitlab').defaults.code_suggestions.auto_filetypes
```

## Release Process
