## Setup

1. Follow the [installation](#installation) steps for your chosen plugin manager.

   1. _Optional:_ Configure GitLab Duo Code Suggestions as an [Omni completion](#omni-completion) provider.

1. Setup helptags using `:helptags ALL` for access to [`:help gitlab.txt`](doc/gitlab.txt).

### Installation

To install the GitLab Vim plugin:

1. Clone Neovim's packpath which is included by [packadd](https://neovim.io/doc/user/repeat.html#%3Apackadd) on startup.

   ```shell
   git clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab.vim.git ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/gitlab/start/gitlab.vim
   ```

1. Add the following plugin to your [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) configuration:

   ```lua
   {
     url = "git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab.vim.git",
     lazy = false,
   }
   ```

1. Declare the plugin in your [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) configuration:

   ```lua
   use {
     "git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab.vim.git",
   }
   ```

#### Uninstalling

1. Remove this plugin and any language server binaries with the following commands

      ```shell
      rm -r ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/gitlab/start/gitlab.vim
      rm ~/.local/share/nvim/gitlab-code-suggestions-language-server-*
      ```

### Omni completion

To enable [omni completion](https://neovim.io/doc/user/insert.html#compl-omni-filetypes) using GitLab Duo Code Suggestions:

1. Follow the steps to enable [GitLab Duo Code Suggestions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html) for your GitLab instance (SaaS or self-managed).
1. Enable Code Suggestions for your GitLab group/user.
1. Create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#enable-code-suggestions-in-your-gitlab-saas-account) with the following scopes:

   - `api`
   - `read_user`

1. Install the GitLab Duo Code Suggestions [language server](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab-language-server-for-code-suggestions).

You may find it helpful to configure omni completion's popup menu even for a single suggestion:

   ```lua
   vim.o.completeopt = 'menu,menuone'
   ```

1. Use `ctrl-x ctrl-o` to open the Omni completion popup menu inside of supported filetypes.

### Keymaps

| Mode     | Keymaps                               | Type     | Description                                                                        |
|----------|---------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `INSERT` | `<C-X><C-O>`                          | Builtin  | Requests completions from GitLab Duo Code Suggestions through the language server. |
| `NORMAL` | `<Plug>(GitLabToggleCodeSuggestions)` | `<Plug>` | Toggles Code Suggestions on/off for the current buffer.                            |

1. Builtin keymaps extend existing functionality. For example because Code Suggestions provides an LSP server the builtin `ctrl-x ctrl-o` omni complete keymap works.
1. `<Plug>` keymaps are provided for convenience.

To use `<Plug>(GitLab...)` maps above you must include your own keymap that references it:

```lua
-- Toggle Code Suggestions on/off with CTRL-g in normal mode:
vim.keymap.set('n', '<C-g>', '<Plug>(GitLabToggleCodeSuggestions)')
```

### Statusline

`gitlab.statusline` is enabled by default which hooks into the builtin `statusline` to indicate the status of the GitLab Duo Code Suggestions integration.

```lua
require('gitlab').setup({
  statusline = {
    enabled = false
  }
})
```

## Features

### GitLab Duo Code Suggestions (Beta)

Write code more efficiently by using generative AI to suggest code while youâ€™re developing. To learn more about this feature, see the
[GitLab Duo Code Suggestions documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#enable-code-suggestions-in-vs-code)

This feature is in
[Beta](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/experiment-beta-support.html#beta)
GitLab Duo Code Suggestions is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model. GitLab currently leverages [Google Cloudâ€™s Vertex AI Codey API models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/code/code-models-overview)

No new additional data is collected to enable this feature. Private non-public GitLab customer data is not used as training data.
Learn more about [Google Vertex AI Codey APIs Data Governance](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/data-governance)

Beta users should read about the [known limitations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#known-limitations)

#### Supported Languages

Languages supported by GitLab Duo Code Suggestions can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html#supported-languages).

For your convenience this plugin provides Vim auto-commands to start the LSP integration for some supported filetypes.
That is Ruby is a supported language so the plugin will add a `FileType ruby` auto-command.

You can configure this behavior for additional filetypes through the `code_suggestions.auto_filetypes` setup option.

## Release Process

1. Review whether each merge request since the last release has/requires a changelog entry.

1. Create a new merge request to increment the plugin version.

   1. Update `PLUGIN_VERSION` in [`lua/gitlab/globals.lua`](lua/gitlab/globals.lua).

   1. Add a new `## vX.Y.Z` header above the previous [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) entry.

1. Merge the merge request once it has been approved.

1. Create a new signed Git tag off of the `main` branch.
